# Mithril.js Application Template

Simple template for mithril.js web applications. I tend to use this pattern quite a bit for simple prototyping so I've thrown it together into this template for re-usability. It's pretty stripped down and inefficient as far as module loading goes, but I'll be improving it.

## Usage

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/fuzetsu/mithril-template.git # clone repo without history
cd mithril-template 
rm -rf .git # get rid of repository
npm install
node server.js
```
Then just go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and the sample home page should greet you.
